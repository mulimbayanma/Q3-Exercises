<p>Around October 2018, we visited Osaka, Japan. I was 9 years old at that time. It was a really fun time and it was definitely memorable. We stayed there for about 5 days, and in those 5 days, we were able to visit many places like Kyoto and Universal Studios. Though I remembered I didn't like Universal Studios because there were clowns and other stuff because it was Halloween. We stayed at a hotel where it was near a lot of restaurants. The people were very kind and trustworthy. In Kyoto, we saw the Kinkaku-ji, which was the golden temple that was usually visited by tourists. It was really memorable and I hope I can visit Japan again.</p>
